## Description

The social network api that I created demonstrate MongoDB in an action. The main function of this application is to help you create new users, post thoughts for that user. You can also react with comments.

User will also have an option to add other users as friend to their list and because of which they will be able to interact with each other's comments.

Lastly, features like users, thoughts, reaction, and list of friends can be deleted as well.
